# Intune App Badging System

Version [1.0](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-partner-badge/releases) 

See [release notes](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-partner-badge/releases) for more information.

This has everything you need to badge your partner app's icon with the Intune logo. This is an _optional_ way to style the icon of an app that has integrated the Intune App SDK and enables Intune mobile application management (MAM).

**Why should you badge your app?** If your app is in a public app store, Intune customers may recognize your app and want to manage and deploy it to their information workers using Intune mobile application management policies.

Read and follow the guidelines to add the Intune badge to your app icon. 

For examples, see the [Intune app partner page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-apps). Apps that use the badge include the Intune Managed Browser and Adobe Acrobat Reader for Microsoft Intune.
